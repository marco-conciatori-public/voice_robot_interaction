- When outside my home wi-fi network (robot hotspotted through my smartphone), voice interaction often breaks down and
 requires a full restart, especially when requiring interaction with the arm camera.

- sometimes, when restarting the script main script without restarting the Jetson NANO, the microphone resource is not
released correctly, causing the newly launched script to give an error when trying to access the microphone. There
should be a linux command for resetting the microphone, which should solve the problem (can be automatically called
 when the specific error is detected). But I don't know if it actually works, and have not tested it for now.
