- when the gemini-2.5-flash model (for reasoning) daily calls are exhausted, switch automatically to gemini-2.0-flash.
- when the gemini-2.5-flash model (for reasoning) daily calls are exhausted, stop the voice interaction entirely.
- when the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts model (for Text-To-Speech) daily calls are exhausted
    - all the points below are already implemented, but have never been tested. In particular, it is not clear if the
    code for detecting daily calls limit works or not.
    - print responses in the console, in case the user connects remotely to the robot or a screen is connected to the
     robot
    - specifically print to console the last sentence (the one that gave the error/signal of finished usage) because it
     would otherwise not be played nor written
    - play the pre-recorded audio saying to the notifying the user of the situation

- add hardware for measuring the charge of the battery connected to the Jetson NANO (through the expansion board),
since they have no ability to do so.
    - then add code to monitor and handle the battery level.
        - signal user with sound when battery charge is too low.
        - power off the Jetson NANO when battery charge is too low.

- The client/server application is only used for sending robot commands from the Jetson NANO to the RDK-X3 pc (commands
to the robot from voice interaction).

- change prompt for reasoning agent, with the current one, it does not respond to anything unrelated to controlling the
robot.
    - check if the new prompt is better
